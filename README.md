This is a tool for Etrian Odyseey 2 Untold's Advertisement "mini-game". 

# Instructions
1. Extract anywhere and run.
2. Select a ward, your highest unlocked recipes (stars), and plug in each customer group and its population.
3. Click Calculate to get the highest selling food for those customers.
4. If you can't make that food (ran out of ingredients or haven't unlocked it yet), you can click Next/Prev to see the next most profitable foods in order.

# Notes
* Requires Microsoft .NET Framework v4.5. Get it from here if you don't have it: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653
* Special thanks to **First_Star** for creating the advertisement spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bh2wEBRjhpqPpTfZA5jIclHpE1ZXHzYtUeoS7nQO4jM/
* Diamond (Grimoire) groups seem to vary in population, anywhere from less than 10 to more than 25. This program estimates them at around the same population as the 4-people icon (usually an overestimation).
* GPL License 2.0 (See LICENSE file)
* I only tested it with Windows 8 64-bit, but it *should* work on other Windows as long as you have .NET Framework v4.5.
* Please post any bugs here or on the Github issues page, thanks.
